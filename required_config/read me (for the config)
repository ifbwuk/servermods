download enchancement.json inside .minecraft/config and overwrite/replace it. if you still have an issue blame the fucking mod
if it does NOT overwrite/replace then i probably made a spelling mistake in the config name. check if the mod Enchancement and the config file name are the same. if not then correct config name pls
